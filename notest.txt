Praw can be used for scraping comments from reddit

This will get a list of all comments hitting reddit
>>> import praw
>>> r = praw.Reddit('Comment parser example by u/_Daimon_')
>>> all_comments = r.get_comments('all')


The strategy: Constantly query all comments to get 
1) the users username
2) the sub reddit
3) vote count

We can track everywhere a single user posts over time to generate a network graph of user interactivity. Perhaps this ought to be constrained by whether those posts were upvoted or not - some way to determine whether itâ€™s the user trolling (e.g. SRD or the SJW trolling people).
